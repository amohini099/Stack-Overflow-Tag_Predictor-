# Stack-Overflow-Tag_Predictor-
1. Predict the tags (a.k.a. keywords, topics, summaries), given only the question text and its title with with high precision and recall No strict latency constraints.
2.Stack Overflow is a popular question-and-answer website for programming and development topics. Users can ask and answer questions, and tag their questions with relevant tags to help others find and understand the content. It is common for users to forget to add tags to their questions, or to add incomplete or inaccurate tags.
3. A machine learning model for predicting tags for Stack Overflow questions could be used to suggest tags for new questions or to improve the accuracy of existing tags. The model could be trained on a large dataset of past Stack Overflow questions and their tags, and then use this training data to predict tags for new questions. The model might use techniques such as natural language processing and classification to analyze the content of the questions and suggest appropriate tags.
